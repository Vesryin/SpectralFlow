    <h2>About Richie</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Richie—just a passionate musician who's walked a tough road and is using music to help others do the same. I'm not a celebrity, just a person who believes in rhythm, honesty, and showing up for people in need. I’ve seen how music can save lives, including my own. I created Spectral Flow because I believe in second chances, and I want to offer hope through sound, connection, and expression.</p>

    <h2>Why AI?</h2>
    <p>We use AI to help create a balanced and non-biased experience. From personalized support suggestions to creative collaborations, AI acts as a supportive advisor—not a replacement for real connection. It helps us focus more time on you and your journey.</p>
