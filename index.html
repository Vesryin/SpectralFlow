    <h2>Welcome to Spectral Flow</h2>
    <p>Spectral Flow is more than a name—it's a sanctuary where trauma meets transformation, and rhythm becomes a roadmap to recovery. Born from the ashes of addiction, isolation, and pain, our project exists to help others rise. Music isn't just sound here; it's therapy, truth, and expression. We use powerful tools like AI, immersive sound design, and raw human connection to help individuals reclaim their stories and rewrite their futures. Every beat we make carries intention. Every lyric, a revelation. Every session, a chance to feel human again.</p>
    <p>Through blog posts, vlogs, and community collabs, we document the journey, the healing, and the hope. Whether you're lost, recovering, or simply seeking resonance—you're home now. Let Spectral Flow remind you: there is no such thing as too far gone. There's only the next note in your melody. And we're here to help you play it.</p>
